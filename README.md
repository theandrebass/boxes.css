# boxes.css

Add some dimension to your page with boxes ðŸš€

You can check out examples and get started with **boxes.css** at the [GitHub Page ðŸ“–](https://github.com/theandrebass/boxes.css/). Here's what boxes.css UI looks like, from the documentation.

Start by adding the boxes.css stylesheet to your page's `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/boxes.css/dist/boxes.min.css" />
```

## Theming

boxes.css supports theming. By default, boxes are turquoise-green. (Why? because it's a unique color.) But you can use [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) to modify the color and add things like a dark theme.

Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/theandrebass/boxes.css) for the full details.
